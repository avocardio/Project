# Bird Species with Data Distillation

<p align="center"><img src='Data\valid\ABBOTTS BABBLER\1.jpg' width=200></p>

This is the final project for the course 'Intro to ANNs with Tensorflow'.

## Description

As the first step of our project, we use a Lightweight* Convolutational Neural Network to classify images of birds from the [Bird Species](https://www.kaggle.com/gpiosenka/100-bird-species) dataset. A detailed description of the dataset can be found in Documentation.md (create link). The images are stored in the `Data/` folder. 

In the second step of your project, we attempt to use 2 types of preprocessing techniques, namely data augmentation and *data distillation*. Definitions of these concepts are given in Documentation.md (create link).

Finally, we want to compare our results to check, if data distillation is indeed able to train and perform more efficiently than our Lightweight* Convolutional Network.
